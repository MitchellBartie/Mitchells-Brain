***Parts of a flat

### Stacking flats:
• Flats must be stacked close to vertical whilst ensuring adequate ‘foot’ (Distance from wall to bottom or foot of flat.) 1 in 10 is a rough minimum gradient as a rule-of-thumb but top-heavy flats may need more foot.
• Stack uncovered or unpainted frames so that the identification marks are all at the same edge for quick selection.
• Stack painted flats alternately face to face and back to back to prevent hardware and other accessories on the backs of flats from damaging the covering or paint job on other flats. Flats painted in gloss are an exception to this rule, the painted surfaces may stick together.
• Care must be taken when removing a flat from a wall stack as air pressure or paint may cause flats to stick together.
• When a show is in performance, store flats in the order in which they are to be used. Establish two packs: the live pack from which flats are to be taken during scene changes, and the dead pack on which flats are stacked as they are struck from stage. Re-set the packs between performances.

### Raising and Lowering flats:

### Edge Up Lifting
• 1 person lift
Depending on the weight, shape and size, 1 person can lift a small single flat, or two small flats that are hinged together and folded.
1. Lift one side of the flat so it rests on edge on one stile. If hinged, hinged side is up.
2. Move to the bottom rail, and then grasp the upper corner with both hands
3. Foot the lower corner and then pull
4. When the flat comes upright, grasp the stile with both hands
5. If the flat frame has no covering, it is lowered by the same process
NB: This should not be attempted if two people are available to lift, or if the flat is too big and/or heavy for one person.

• 2 person lifting
1. Lift one side of the flat so it rests on edge on one stile
2. One person stands directly in front of the bottom rail with hands on the stile and a foot against the bottom corner
3. Second person starts to lift from the top rail and continues following down the stile and over hand until the flat is vertical.
4. The person at the foot can remove his foot from the base once the flat has passed 45° whilst continuing to apply downward pressure on the corner.
5. The person at the foot controls the balance of the flat.

### Walk Up Lifting
Used to raise a heavy or large flat or wall, or 2 or more flats attached to one another.
1. One or more people “foot” the bottom rail of the set piece
2. Other crew distribute themselves along the top rail at the stiles
3. Crew members simultaneously raise the top of the piece and advance under it, handling only the stiles or toggle rails as the flat is raised to a vertical position
4. Those at the foot can assist by pulling on lash lines attached to the top rail
5. If the weight is concentrated near the top of a piece, or if the stiles are flimsy, padded poles or stage braces must be employed by the crew member either raising or lowering the piece to prevent excessive bending or possible breaking of the stiles. A convenient lifting pole is a stage broom with its handle inserted into a tube, the bristle end placed against the face of the flat, avoiding damage to the flat’s finish.

### Floating a Flat
Used to lower flats, or multi flat units. If the flat is covered, the air cushioning effect on the large expanse of cloth or plywood is employed to float it down.
1. Check the floor area in front of the flat is clear of people and objects and is also clean (sweep if necessary)
2. Place a foot against the bottom rail to prevent kickback.
3. Call out “Flat floating, mind your eyes” (Dust is often blown around)
4. Release the flat and let it fall forward
5. Air resistance will cushion the fall and the flat will descend slowly to the floor
6. Floating relieves the structural elements of the flat of all strain
This technique is not suitable for flats that have uncovered openings, as there will be insufficient air compression to support the descending flat. It also cannot be used on elements that have heavy ornaments, or trimming on the front face. To lower these, use a reverse of the Edge Up or Walk up techniques.
NB: A gust of air movement is created when floating a flat so care must be taken that any loose material does not get blown around. (Remove paper, boxes of glitter etc.) If loose material cannot be removed walk the flat down.

### Running a Flat
This is used to move standing flats along the floor.
Most flats can be run by one person but if two people are available, this is preferable
• For two folded flats, they are grasped at the hinged edge and moved with the fold at the leading edge.
• When one flat of a hinged unit is larger than the other, the crewperson holds and moves the folded piece from the side of the larger flat, and keeps the small flat leaning against it.
1. Stand at the rear of the flat (to avoid marks on the face of the flat), facing in the direction the flat is going to run.
2. Grab the front stile with 2 hands- one hand on the leading edge of the flat as high as possible, and the other as low as possible, at a point that is comfortable and safe for lifting (no higher than waist level).
3. With both elbows straight, and the flat slightly tilted towards the crew member, raise the leading edge slightly, just to clear obstructions.
4. Move forward rapidly, sliding the flat along the floor.
5. With two people, the leader lifts and balances, while the follower pushes and balances, allowing the rear of the flat to drag.
• For three fold or very large flats, 2 or more people are necessary. The second person holds the trailing edge and assists in propelling and balancing the piece, but does not lift.
• When the piece is tall (over 5 metres) and is being run, a third person with a padded pole, broom or stage brace is needed to balance the top of the flat.
• Wood wings, profile trees, screens etc are run as flats
If the need arises to lift a flat over obstacles, at least two people are required.
• Keep flat erect as possible.
• Each person holds the flat as if to run it (one hand high one hand low) opposite to the other person. The leader in this case will face the flat and ensure hand positions mirror those opposite. Injury can occur if a person is ‘Wrong-handed’ by his partner.
• Leader communicates with a count when the lift will occur.

### 4 Corner Lifting
Used for lifting and carrying flat (Parallel to the ground); three dimensional scenery, rostra or large flats.
• Needs four people, preferably of a similar height and strength.
• Ensure the pathway or route to be taken is clear of obstacles and doors are open.
• A leader is selected and communicates how and when the piece will be lifted.
• 4 people position themselves equally around the object (if a single Rostrum, on each of the four corners).
• Using safe lifting techniques (bending at the knees and a straight back), all four people lift, walk and set down the piece in unison, following the leader’s count and instruction.
