There are several behaviours that are considered bad manners or unacceptable on and around the stage. Some of these rules and taboos are based on sound OH&S and performance reasons. Others are superstitions which may have had rational reason in the past but have been retained for tradition’s sake. Whatever the origin or reason, these ‘rules’ are in place universally and are expected to be respected. Some items below are discussed in greater detail later in this document.
