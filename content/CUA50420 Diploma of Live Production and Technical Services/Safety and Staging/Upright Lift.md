### Common Risks:
- Fall from a height
- Injury occurring from objects falling from a height
- Injury occurring as result of faulty machinery
- Injury from moving machinery
- Damage to sets or buildings from improper use 
 
### In General:
- Follow the Safe Work Method
- The upright lifts may only be used by those who have been trained in their use.
- Never store tools, materials etc on top of the mast or in the bucket.
- Ensure all pre-use checks are strictly adhered to and carried out (this must be done either at the beginning of each day and/or when the upright lift has been moved between venues or crews)
- Upright lifts should not be used or moved by less than 2 people
- Do not over-reach out of the lifts, or use in a space too small.
- An Emergency Stop Button (ESB) is located both on the mast of the machine and on the platform, which will instantly stop the lift from operating if needed
- Ensure all wheels of the upright lifts remain on the ground at all times.
- Do not remove outriggers whilst Upright lifts are in use. Should it prove necessary to do so due to the nature of the task, a full risk assessment must be carried out, documented and approved. Such operations may not be undertaken by students and must be performed by trained staff.
- Never replace outriggers with counterweights or other alternatives to activate the safety switches.
- Never move an Upright Lift with a person on the platform.
- Operation Manuals are stored in a tube on the machines and can be accessed for further information, or a refresher if needed

### UL20 Operating Procedure:
Maintenance and Log Book:
- At the beginning of each day, or at initial use, examine equipment for visible faults.
- Person responsible should fill out Log Book at the beginning of day or initial use.
- Ensure operators are trained in the proper use of the lifts.
- Minimum of 2 people are required when lift is in use. 1 in the lift and 1 person on the ground to be a spotter.
- Barricades and safety signs must be deployed as required to ensure the safety of passers by, especially in public areas.

### Outrigger Installation
1. Fold out the 2 rear outriggers
2. Orientate the 2 rear outriggers to an angle of approximately 45 degrees and then push in until the locking pin engages
3. Pull out the front two outriggers until the locking pin engages
4. Turn handle on screw jack pad to secure outrigger
5. Level the base by centring the bubble in the orbit level
6. All four screw jack pads must be in solid contact with a firm surface and each outrigger indicator light must be lit before the platform is elevated
NB: All 4 wheels of the UL20 must remain on the ground

### Operation
1. Check for external damage to the mast.
2. Connect to 240V power using the power lead provided.
3. Turn the key switch, located on the left side of the mast, ON.
4. Pull out the Emergency Stop Button (ESB) on the mast and in the platform.
5. To access the platform: raise the middle bar at the front of the cage
6. Ensure the cage has been properly closed and secured before raising the platform.
7. Check the area above or below the platform is clear before raising or lowering the platform
8. Do not lean over the safety barrier or suspend or balance anything outside the safety barrier.
9. Call “fingers’ before moving to ensure everyone is clear of moving parts.
10. When work is completed, ensure the platform is clear of all rubbish, the platform has been lowered, and the power lead has been rolled and stored in the platform.
11. The Upright Lifts are to be returned to the rear-stage of the Parade Theatre for storage.

### Moving from Venue to Venue
1. Ensure the mast is completely lowered
2. Ensure the power lead is unplugged
3. Loosen outriggers and return to storage positions, by releasing the locking pins
4. 1 person should guide the machine from the front, and 1 person should push using the handles at the rear of the machine

9. Do not lean over the safety barrier or suspend or balance anything outside the safety barrier
10. When work is completed, ensure the platform is clear of all rubbish, the platform has been lowered, and power lead has been rolled and stored in the platform.

### Moving the UL40 from Venue to Venue
A minimum of two people are required to move the UL40
To fit through standard doorways, the UL40 needs to be lowered to its moving position.
When moving through a doorway double-check that the back of the mast is fully compressed to clear the top of doorways.
Lowering:
1. Ensure the mast is completely lowered.
2. Ensure the power lead is unplugged.
3. Remove the outriggers and return to storage positions.
4. Be sure the area is clear of personnel and obstructions.
5. Whilst holding the Tilt Back Frame, remove the R-Clip retainer and retaining pin
6. Lower the Tilt back Frame until the hole in the cylinder assembly aligns with the upper mounting bracket pinhole. Secure using the retaining pin and R-Clip retainer
7. Extend the Tilt Back Handle to the extended position by releasing the locking pin and pulling out the handle
8. Push down on the Tilt back Handle until the machine comes to rest on the Tilt Back Frame (2 people need)
9. Pull down on the handle on the back of the mast to compress the cylinder assembly
10. Return the Tilt Back Handle to storage position
11. 1 person should guide the machine at the front, and another push from rear of the machine
Raising
1. Push up the mast to extend the cylinder assembly
2. Fully extend the Tilt Back Handle until the locking pin engages
3. 2 people lift using the Tilt Back Handle, (ensure proper lifting techniques are observed- bend at the knees)
4. Return the Tilt Back Handle to the storage position, ensuring the locking pin engages
5. Whilst holding the Tilt back frame, remove retaining pin and raise the Tilt Back assembly to the stowed position. Secure with the Retaining pin and R-Clip
