The Production Analysis is a good starting point for budgetary discussions in future [[Production Meetings]] with [[Directors]], [[Producers]], and [[Designers]]. It is important in the Production Analysis to mention any technical, financial, and acting choices or requirements that will not be possible to achieve within a production's budget. It is crucial that this is done in the early stages of a production so [[Directors]] don't assume that everything is possible and plan everything. 

The Production Analysis is an important tool that should be used as a guide throughout the [[Preproduction]] phase to highlight requirements for quick changes, crossovers, changeovers, and to assist the [[Directors]] and actors in understanding which entrances and exits may become challenging because of quick costume changes or the actors needing to appear somewhere else on stage in the next scene. 

All areas of the production must be included in the Production Analysis because it will be used as a source to create the [[Agenda]] for [[Production Meetings]]. As meetings are held, it is important to update any changes that are decided upon. The Production Analysis can be used as a base for the [[Costume Plot]], [[Props Preset]], and [[Running Sheet]]. 

Eight columns should be set out with the following headings:
 . Act/Scene/Page
 . Costumes
 . Scenery
 . Lighting
 . [[Props]]
 . Sound
 . Special Effects
 . Notes

The Act/Scene/Page column of the Production Analysis marks where in the script or production something happens, such as a lighting, sound, or acting cue. To record where you are in the script, Roman numerals are used for the Act number, Arabic numeral for the Scene number, and "p" for the Page number. 

In the Costumes column, information for the [[Costume Plot]] and [[Actor-Scene Breakdown]] is recorded. It is important to record a basic description of the character, for example their age, costume, and name. Along with this information, it should be noted here if this changes throughout the production because plans for costume and make up changes will need to be created. Another crucial bit of information to record here are all entrances and exits for each character. This information can be used to schedule [[Rehearsals]], and form a basis for discussions about [[Understudies]] and [[Covers]]. The [[Stage Manager]] also needs to take note of any costume changes that aren't mentioned such as expected changes when it is a different time of day, or different weather. It is also very important to take note of what the actors do with the costumes. For example, if they need to remove clothing, rip clothing off, if fake blood is used, and if a character requires pockets. This is because all of these factors will require extra planning for artistic and financial purposes.

In the Scenery column, all of the set details should be recorded. This includes what set pieces are used, the setting, and any scenery shifts. The [[Stage Manager]] also needs to be aware of:
 . All doors and their locations within a set
 . If any costumes, [[Props]], or furniture will have a collision with doorframes that they enter or exit through
 . If there is a [[Raked Stage]] 
 . Anything that actors take on or off stage
 . Elevated acting areas that will require extra safety planning such as railings and exit stairs
 . Curtains or blinds that are operated by actors
 . Set that is flown in or out during the scene

In the Lighting column, any lighting changes such as time, weather, mood, or [[Special Effects]] such as lightning occur during the scene should be recorded. It is also important to note any blackouts that occur so extra planning for actors or set pieces moving on or backstage during a blackout can be created. 

The [[Props]] column should indicate all [[Props]] required in the scene, including ones that are referenced but not specifically mentioned in the stage directions. Take note of all [[Perishable Props]] that are used, and if possible, the setting of each prop. This information can be used to form the preliminary [[Props List]]. 

In the Sound column, record all sound effects within the scene, and if any voice overs require a [[Microphone]] backstage. It is also important to determine whether the actors will require microphones during the production early because plans need to be made for [[Microphone]] placement on costumes, and if any costume changes will be complicated by the use of a [[Microphone]]. For finance reasons, record the location a sound emits from so the appropriate sound equipment can be budgeted. Any music within the scene needs to be noted, including its source such as a live instrument or pre-recorded. Copyrighted music needs to be included so [[Management]] can be alerted to secure the rights. If an actor needs to play an instrument on stage, it is also important to record this so discussions and plans can be created in [[Production Meetings]] if the actor doesn't know how to play the instrument. 

The Special Effects column is where information about elements such as blood bags, explosions, flames, water, or other Special Effects are recorded. This is important because Special Effects often require complicated multi-department planning in [[Production Meetings]]. 

In the Notes column, information on special requirements such as the need for fight directors, dialect coaches, or special cueing should be recorded here. Also include anything that will require permits or licensing such as weapons, explosives, pyrotechnics, effects that involve the audience, or other things like working with animals or child actors.
