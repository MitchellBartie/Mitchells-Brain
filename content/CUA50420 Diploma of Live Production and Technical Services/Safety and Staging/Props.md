| Furniture Props  | Furniture that is used by an actor is considered a Furniture Prop, if a piece of furniture is on stage but is not used by an actor it would be considered scenery.<br><br>A Furniture Prop includes any furniture used by an actor whether they sit, stand or make any sort of physical contact with the object, for example a furniture prop could be a chair a character sits on, a table could be sat at or even stood on, same for a dresser or even a bed.<br><br>If a piece of furniture is to be stood on top of it must be able to handle the weight of the actor (in brief circumstances the furniture may be made in a way so to purposefully break when the actor uses it, this of course must be thoroughly planned as to avoid any personal injury) if the object is unable to hold the weight of the actor a stronger substitute must be used, if the director is set on using that specific object it can be reinforced but this should be avoided in most circumstances.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| Consumable Props | Items that can be eaten, broken or manipulated in a way that makes them non reusable. These items must be replaced after each run and there must be enough supplied to last for performances as well as rehearsals.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| Running Props    | Props, or other associated items such as batteries, that will need replenishing at regular intervals are referred to as running props. These may include consumables and some practicals, but they will not necessarily be running props as they can be acquired in bulk for a whole run. Budget may affect this decision.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| Set Dressing     | Involves adding props, furniture and other set pieces to enhance the world of the play, this usually doesn’t involve large set pieces but rather small items like a picture frame or throw pillows.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| Rehearsal Props  | Rehearsal props stand in for the actual prop as the actor works out the stage action and movement in the rehearsal process. Many theatres use an odd gathering of cast-off furniture pieces to set the rehearsal space.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| Personal Props   | Hand props that enhance or are part of the character. Often chosen with the costume in mind, these props sometimes stay with the costume and are carried by the character. E.g.; glasses, watch, walking stick, wand, cigarette, etc.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| Stand in Props   | A secondary prop used by actors when the primary prop is being constructed or sourced. Can also be used when the primary prop is damaged or missing.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| Costume Props    | Some props, such as jewellery, are integral to a performer's costume and are referred to as 'costume props'. It is usual for these to be the responsibility of the costume supervisor, although items such as wallets, handbags, handkerchiefs, umbrellas, even watches, while obviously helping to define character like using the handkerchiefs to use when they are sick (action) , may be considered either costume or hand props .It is important to establish whose responsibility it is to find these. A useful guide is that if the prop needs<br><br>to coordinate closely with the costume, for instance matching colour or style, then it can be considered costume. Sometimes it is necessary to negotiate who takes responsibility for these ambiguous areas, particularly when working to a tight budget, or when either costume or stage management have a particularly heavy workload.<br><br>Sometimes costumes themselves have an element of the 'prop' about them, requiring the skills of the prop-maker in their construction as well as that of the costume constructor. Animal costumes, for instance, might require this level of collaboration. Masks are also frequently considered to be 'costume props'.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| Practical Props  | Any prop that performs its real-life function on stage. If the prop needs to be lit up or make a noise it is considered a practical prop. E.g. electrical props - lamps that need to be lit up, mobile phones that ring.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |

| Props List       | A props list is a big spreadsheet of all the props used during a show. It can consist of a variety of information including the act and scene in which the prop is used and where it is preset, how many of the same prop there is, whether it is consumable, who uses the prop, and any notes about the prop.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |

| Props Preset<br> | When a prop is onstage prior to the show starting for instance for a show that is set in one place and doesn’t change locations a table and chair may be pre-set on stage and may not move for the entire show or maybe removed during intermission if it is not efficient to bring it off due to its size or weight. This would also apply to a show that has several locations on at any one time but only the area with action is lit.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
