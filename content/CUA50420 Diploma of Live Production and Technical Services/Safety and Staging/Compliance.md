Compliance is the [[Legal Responsibilities]] and [[Ethical Responsibilities]] that both individuals and organisations have within the workplace and industry. Compliance is achieved by adhering to [[Regulations]], [[Guidelines]], [[Australian Standards]], [[Codes of Practice]] and [[Requirements]]. The two areas of Compliance are [[Regulatory Compliance]] and [[Corporate Compliance]]. 
It is important to get approval through the appropriate measures before the Compliance related activity commences. Ways to get approval include raising the activity in [[Production Meetings]], emailing the appropriate personnel that have to authority to provide approval, and listing the activity on a [[Risk Assessment]]. Any relevant paperwork needs to be included with the [[Risk Assessment]] such as a [[Safe Work Method Statement]], and all interactions need to be documented including everyone involved, and who gives the approval to commence the activity.
