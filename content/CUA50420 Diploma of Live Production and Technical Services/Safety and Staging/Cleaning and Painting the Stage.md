The stage is swept and mopped prior to any rehearsals (including Technical Rehearsals), or performances to ensure that no objects can cause injury and that scenery, costumes and props remain clean and protected.
• The stage is swept and mopped before folding any soft hangings.
• For large stage areas, at least 2 people are required to sweep and mop.
Sweeping the stage

### Prior to mopping:
1. Start downstage, and sweep across the stage to centre from both PS and OP (ensure all corners are swept)
2. Having completed this process, sweep downstage to upstage.
3. Use a dust pan to clean away the final rubbish and dirt.
4. When completed put away brooms and dust pans.

### Mopping the stage:
1. Ensure the mop is clean (rinse before use)
2. Fill mop buckets with hot water only. No detergents are to be used. Methylated spirits may be added to remove scuff marks and other stains and to hasten drying time.)
3. Using broad strokes, mop across stage from centre to PS and OP, starting downstage and working upstage.
4. Water may need to be changed frequently if the stage is dirty. Never mop with dirty water.
5. After use, thoroughly rinse mops and mop buckets and leave mop head up to dry thoroughly
NB Mopping across stage rather than up and down the stage ensures the lines created by the mopping process are not obvious to the audience

### Painting the stage:
1. Before commencing, the stage and wings should be swept and mopped, and left to dry properly
2. “Cut-in” around edges and obstructions with a medium sized brush.
3. Using a roller, paint the stage in only one direction, taking care not to paint oneself into any corners.
4. Rollers and equipment must be cleaned immediately after use.
5. Painting equipment must not be washed in the sink. All paintbrushes, rollers etc must be washed out in the specially filtered sink on the paint floor in the workshop.
6. When the painting equipment is clean and dry it should be returned to storage
