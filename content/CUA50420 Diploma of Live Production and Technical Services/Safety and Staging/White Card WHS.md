### CPCWHS1001 Prepare to work safely in the construction industry

### Introduction: Legislation and Purpose
In Australia there is specific legislation that relates to the health and safety in the workplace. The aim of this legislation is to provide a framework to secure the safety and health of people whenever they are at work.

In NSW we currently have the :
• Work Health and Safety Act 2011 No 10
• Work Health and Safety Regulation 2017

### The WHS Act aims to:
• Protect the health and safety of workers and other people by eliminating or minimizing risks arising from work or workplaces
• Ensure fair and effective representation, consultation and cooperation to address and resolve health and safety issues
• Promote information and training relating to health and safety
• Provide effective compliance and enforcement measures, and
• Deliver progressively higher standards of work health and safety.

### The Work Health & Safety Legislative Framework:
The New South Wales Work Health and Safety Act (2011) sets out the general legal obligations that must be complied with in order to provide for the health and safety of workers.

The New South Wales Work Health and Safety Regulation (2017) expands on the requirements of the act, with details of how certain sections of the act are implemented, and specific direction on how to meet those obligations.

A Code of Practice provides practical guidance on how to comply with the Regulations and Act.

[[Australian Standards]] are published documents that set out specifications and procedures designed to ensure products, services and systems are safe, reliable and consistently perform the way they were intended to.

Industry Standards and Guidance Notes are developed:
• from commonly adopted practices within industries
• by agreement between PCBUs and Workers, and
• as a result of recommendations from advisory bodies

### Construction Work:
WHS Legislation defines construction work as... ‘any work carried out in connection with the construction, alteration, conversion, fitting out, commissioning, renovation, repair, maintenance, refurbishment, demolition, decommissioning or dismantling of a structure.’ Work Health and Safety Regulation (2011) Section 289 Meaning of “construction work”.

### Roles and Responsibilities:
The Work Health and Safety Legislation outlines four different roles that a person may have in and around a workplace. These are:
• a Person Conducting a Business or an Undertaking (PCBU)
• an Officer
• a Worker
• Other Persons
The Legislation places certain responsibilities, or duties, on each of these persons in order to provide for the health and safety of all Workers in a workplace.

### PCBU:
The WHS legislation uses the term person conducting a business or undertaking' (PCBU) instead of what was previously termed an ‘employer’. For the purpose of the WHS Legislation a PCBU
includes:
• Sole traders
• Unincorporated associations
• Partnerships
• Companies
• Principal contractors, sub contractors
• Government departments and authorities 
A PCBU includes not for profit businesses or undertakings. Volunteer organisations that employ people are also PCBUs under the WHS legislation.

### Officer:
An ‘officer’ is a person that takes part in making decisions that affect the whole, or a substantial part, of the business of the corporation or who has the capacity to significantly affect the corporation’s financial standing.
An officer may be:
• a board member
• a director or secretary of a corporation
• a person involved in making major decisions within the corporation
• a receiver, or manager, of the property of a corporation
• an administrator
• a liquidator of a corporation
• a trustee or other person administering an arrangement

### Worker:
A person is a worker if they carry out work in any capacity for conducting a business or undertaking (PCBU). 
This includes working as:
• an employee
• a contractor or subcontractor
• an employee of a contractor or subcontractor
• an apprentice or trainee
• a student gaining work experience
• a volunteer
A person conducting the business or undertaking (PCBU) can also be a worker if they carry out work in that business or undertaking.

### Other Persons:
Any other person that enters a workplace and is not considered a worker also has duties under the Work Health and Safety legislation.
Examples of ‘other persons’ include:
• Clients
• Visitors or guests of workers
• Students
• Members of the general public

### Duties:
The NSW WHS Act (2011) outlines the general health and safety duties of PCBU's, Officers, Workers and Others at a workplace which require the duty holder to ensure the health and safety of themselves and others, so far as is reasonably practicable, by eliminating risks to health and safety.
Duty of care means to act in a way that does not put others at risk or potential harm. PCBU's, Officers, Workers and Others all have duty of care.

### Duties - Three principles:
1. Duties are not transferable Meaning that you cannot get someone else to do your duty.

2. A person may have more than one duty For example a person could be a PCBU as well as a worker so have to be responsible for duties given to both roles.

3. More than one person can have a duty For example there may be more than one officer that looks after a particular duty listed in the WHS Legislation.

'Duty of care' is the legal responsibility of everyone, including:
• PCBU's
• Self employed persons
• Construction supervisors
• Workers
• Designers
• Manufacturers and suppliers
• Sub contractors
• Inspectors

### Primary Duty of Care - PCBU:
A PCBU has the 'primary duty of care'. This means that a PCBU has the primary responsibility to ensure that, as far as reasonably practicable, workers are safe from injury and risk to health while at work. 
The PCBU should
• provide a safe working environment, facilities, amenities, systems and equipment. For example, providing WHS information, training and first aid equipment.
• Consult with workers on safety related issues.
• Supply adequate first aid for workers.

### Duty of Workers:
The WHS Legislation states Workers must:

a) take reasonable care of their own health and safety while at work
b) take reasonable care that the things they do or don't do does not adversely affect the health and safety of other persons
c) comply with any reasonable instruction given by the PCBU to ensure compliance with regulations
d) cooperate with any reasonable work health and safety policy or procedure of their organization.

Therefore:
• do not work under the influence of alcohol
• do not take alcohol/ drugs that impact on your ability to perform work
• Smoke only in designated areas, extinguish cigarettes to prevent a fire hazard and dispose of butts appropriately.
• manage and report on medication that may impact on your ability to work safely
• make sure you are fit and well to attend work
• maintain awareness of safety procedures
• when using amenities, clean up after yourself, use rubbish bins, report unclean, unhygienic or damaged amenities and consider others who may need them.

### Consultation:
Consultation is a legal requirement and an essential part of managing health and safety risks. Two duties in particular are outlined in the legislation.
1. Duty to consult with other duty holders If more than one person has a duty relating to the same matter, each person with the duty must, so far as is reasonably practicable, consult, co operate and co ordinate activities with all other people that have that duty.
2. Duty to consult workers The person conducting a business or undertaking (PCBU) must, so far as is reasonably practicable, consult with workers who carry out work for the business or undertaking who are, or are likely to be, directly affected by a matter relating to work health or safety. 
 
 Consultation is important because it
• helps to identify hazards and risks in the workplace
• is a legal requirement; PCBU's must consult with workers about safety
• it provides a way for workers to raise concerns about safety.

Consultation is about encouraging cooperation and partnerships between management and workers to ensure health and safety in the workplace.

### Roles of Designated WHS Personnel:

### Health and Safety Committee:
Brings together workers and management to assist in the development and review of health and safety procedures for the workplace. They can also make recommendations to improve work practices, equipment, training etc. The Committee must meet at least every three months to discuss workplace safety issues.

### Health and Safety Representative (HSR):
The PCBU is obliged to provide an HSR with an approved course of training as soon as practicable and within 3 months of any request. An HSR can help you to raise any WHS issues or concerns that you may have.

### Work Group:
Any worker may request their PCBU to facilitate the election of one or more Health and Safety Representatives to represent workers of one or more work groups. A work group is determined by negotiation and agreement between the PCBU and the workers that will form the group(s).

### Work Health and Safety is a shared responsibility:
Supervisors must take reasonable steps to ensure the safety of their workers. First Aid Officers are trained to provide emergency first aid to injured workers Work Health and Safety is a shared responsibility!
Examples of safe work practices on a construction site:
• not taking any unnecessary risks
• always looking out for potential hazards
• always using Personal Protective Equipment and clothing
• Smoke only in designated areas, extinguish cigarettes and dispose of butts appropriately.
• keeping your work area clean and tidy
• using plant, tools and equipment that are in safe working order
• entering and leaving the workplace using proper routes
• never being under the influence of drugs or alcohol at work, or bringing them to the workplace
• helping to prevent bullying and harassment
• when using amenities such as lunch room or toilets, clean up after yourself, report unclean, unhygienic or damaged amenities and treat amenities with consideration of others.

### Safe systems of work:
The PCBU should provide information regarding safe systems of work.
• the physical boundaries of the workplace
• entry and exit points
• evacuation procedures and assembly points

### Storing Equipment and Materials:
These should be stored in a safe and organised way which allows them to be retrieved
again safely. The way materials and equipment are stored should also be in line with Safety Data Sheets (SDSs) and legislation where this applies.

### Removing Debris:
Debris should continually be removed from a workplace to prevent build up. Build up could affect entry to or exit from site, pose a fire hazard, or affect floors and surfaces. You must ensure that disposal of debris does not create a risk to the environment.

### Site Disturbance:
To minimise site disturbance, vehicles should always use nominated routes. This will limit the amount of mud, soil etc. that will be tracked onto public roads. Loads should also be covered to prevent materials or rubbish from escaping.

### Litter (Rubbish):
Litter includes such things as food scraps and wrappings, waste from packaging and paper. Litter must be disposed of in correct containers (such as garbage bins). Disposal or storage of litter should not pose a risk to the environment, for example it should not be allowed to enter waterways or stormwater drains. Good housekeeping is essential to a safe workplace. This means everyday cleanliness, tidiness and good order in all parts of your work area. This includes maintenance of machinery and equipment to ensure they are in safe and efficient working order.

### High Risk Work Licenses:
Some work activities are considered “High Risk Work” (HRW) and require special training and accreditation. These activities are also controlled by approved Codes of Practice. Safework NSW is the HRW licensing authority in NSW.
A few examples (from a longer list) of work which may require a HRW Licence:
• asbestos removal
• mobile, tower or overhead gantry cranes
• dogging
• dredging
• earthwork drainage
• erecting scaffolding (over 4 metres )
• forklift and reach stacker operation
• personnel and material hoist operation
• laying underground electrical and water services where the work is over or under council streets/footpaths
• gas fitting
• producing, storing and transporting prescribed waste
• rigging
• use of pressure equipment working on or near roads

### Hazards and Risk:
Within the WHS legislation it is important to distinguish between a ‘hazard’ and ‘risk’ as they have distinct meanings and are not interchangeable terms.

### What is a 'hazard'?:
A hazard is a situation or thing that has the potential to cause harm or injury.

### What is 'risk'?:
Risk is the possibility that harm might occur when a person is exposed to a hazard.
