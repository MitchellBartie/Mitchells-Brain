- Damage to the Tallescope from incorrect use 

### Summary:
- Wear the required PPE and follow the Safe Work Method
- Use the safety harness and ascender system.
- Disconnect from ascender once in the bucket. If possible, attach lanyard to suitable point above.
- The Tallescope may only be used by those who have been trained in its use.
- Minimum of 2 people required when the tower is in use (1 person on the ground at all times)
- Ensure outriggers are in place before use
- Never carry loads up the ladder, use a hauling line.
- Never store tools, materials etc in the bucket
- Secure tools etc to yourself to ensure nothing falls

- Safety Harness, shock absorbing lanyard.

### Operating Procedure:
1. Ensure the area around and above the Tallescope is clear of people and obstructions. Place signs and barricades as appropriate.
2. BEFORE raising the ladder to its vertical position, check the rail safety lock at the base of the ladder is engaged properly. This ensures the ladder is at its smallest extension, and will not move when setting up the Tallescope
3. Check the ascender rope is properly attached
4. Raise the bucket and ladder from the horizontal position by pulling down on the end of the ladder, so the bucket swings upwards
5. Ensure the locking mechanism clicks into place when the ladder and bucket are in their vertical position
6. Push the Tallescope into its required position and secure the wheels with the locking mechanism
7. Pull out and lower the 2 outriggers and ensure they are locked in place
8. Raise the bucket by pulling on the ladder rope, until it is at the desired height. The rail locks must engage fully on a rung of the ladder)
9. Ensure safety harness is properly fitted on the climber and the fall arrest is in place before ascending or descending the ladder
10. Attach the harness to the ascender system via the pick up point
11. Using the harness and ascender mechanism, climb the ladder to the bucket. The person on the ground holds and manages the other end of the ascender rope, whilst the climber ascends the ladder. There must only be 1 person at any time on the Tallescope structure.
12. Disconnect lanyard from ascender once in the bucket. If practical, attach to suitable point above.
13. Complete the desired work, with the person on the ground remaining at the base of the Tallescope. Never move the Tallescope with a person in the bucket.
14. Before descending check the bucket is empty, attach lanyard to ascender and descend from the bucket using the safety harness and ascender system in reverse
15. Once on the ground, disconnect from the safety system
16. When all work is complete lower the bucket all the way, using the ladder rope, and check the rail safety locks are engaged properly.
17. Ensure that all persons are out of the way, and the area clear.
18. Lower the Tallescope into the horizontal position by releasing the locking mechanism at the bottom of the ladder (this is a different lock from the rail safety lock) and lowering gently. Take care as the ladder is top-heavy.
19. Secure the two outriggers to their storage height (as marked) and return Tallescope to its storage location.
