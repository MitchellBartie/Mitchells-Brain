### Soft Masking
• Masking is used to hide off-stage equipment and personnel from the audience.
• This masking can be either “hard masking” i.e. flattage, or “soft masking: Wool or velvet drapes known as legs, borders, smothers and tabs)
• There are also several soft hangings that are used for effects: gauze, cycloramas, house curtains)
• Soft hangings should be treated with flame retardant products as required by building codes.

### Legs
• Side curtains used for masking the wing area, that allow for multiple entrances/ exits onto the stage and side lighting.
• Usually rigged in matching pairs OP and PS
• Off-stage edges may ‘return’ IE: fold 90° to run up/down stage to complete mask.

### Borders 
• Used to mask overhead lighting bars, and other rigged elements in the fly tower.
• Usually hung immediately DS of legs.

### Smother 
• Curtain that provides a barrier for scene changes etc.
• Can be used as a black back drop.

### Tabs
• Usually rigged on a tab-track, it is a curtain that is split in the centre and can open evenly to PS & OP by hauling on a sash line (French Action)

### Cyclorama
• Used as a backdrop for lighting effects. Appears to change colour when lit.
• Usually a white filled cloth or plastic screen material.

### Gauze/Scrim
• Usually black or white shark’s tooth gauze
• Front-lit, it masks activity behind
• See-through when people or objects behind it are lit.

### House Curtain
• Often used to hide the stage from the audience, revealing the stage at the top of the show.
• Sometimes brought in to hide scene changes.
• Also effective at masking sound before the start of the show and during scene changes
• ‘Bounced’ I.E: flown in then straight out during curtain calls.

### Panorama Masking
• Runs downstage to upstage, usually rigged on panorama bars
• Fills any gaps in mask offstage of legs.
• Also used to create a ‘black box’ effect without legs.

### Storing Soft Masking
• Depending on the type of fabric, drapes are folded, rolled, gathered or just stuffed into their bag.
• Before folding or rolling any fabrics, the stage or space should be swept and mopped to prevent dirt getting on the cloth.
• The correct methods of folding and rolling ensure that the fabric is protected and ready for the next user to unfold the fabric and rig.
• There is usually hessian webbing along the back of the top edge of the drape. Eyelets are crimped at intervals along the webbing and ties of cord are inserted into them for tying the drape to a bar or track bobbins. The width, height and type of drape are usually marked on the webbing, ideally at both ends. The centre is often marked with a different coloured cord tie.
• The face of the hanging is the side which faces the audience.
• It is important to ensure the webbing and registration are left accessible when it is in its storage position
• When folding wide drapes such as smothers and borders, the folds go to centre to allow the cloth to be easily unfolded ready to tie to the bar.
• When folding long drapes such as legs they are folded along their length before being folded or rolled bottom to top.
• Gauzes or scrims are not usually folded, rather gathered as they are flown in, then tied loosely using some of the head ties, then folded in half before being gently stuffed into a bag, the last to go in being the centre of the cloth.
• Extra care must be taken when folding white drapes as they are easily marked; hands must be washed and/ or clean white gloves worn.
