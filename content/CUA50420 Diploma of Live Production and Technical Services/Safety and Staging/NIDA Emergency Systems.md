### EWIS

NIDA is equipped with an Emergency Warning & Intercom System (EWIS) which automatically sounds an alarm and calls the Fire Brigade if a smoke detector is activated.
All personnel will receive induction into the emergency and evacuation procedures. In the event of an evacuation, it is a legal requirement that personnel follow the instructions of designated ‘Fire Wardens’ who will be wearing hi-visibility vests and hard-hats.
In the Event of an Alarm:
1. The warning tone will sound “Beep Beep-Beep-Beep…” No action is required at this time, the Chief Fire Warden will investigate the source of the alarm.
2. If the alarm stops sounding no action is required. Resume normal activities.
3. If the alarm sound changes to the evacuation tone; “Whoop-Whoop-Whoop-Whoop…” all fire Wardens begin their duties. All personnel must move calmly but quickly (Don’t run!) to their designated assembly area.
4. Maps showing assembly areas are displayed around the building.
Fire Doors
• There are a number of Self Closing Fire Doors at NIDA. They have an electro- magnetic device that allows them to stay open unless the EWIS system goes into alarm.
• These doors provide fire separation from one part of the building to the next and are vital elements in the Fire Safety at NIDA
• The electro-magnetic devices will automatically release the doors in the case of a fire alarm
• DO NOT force these doors closed by pulling on them, as this will break the magnets, and make the system ineffective.
• These doors must not be wedged open by any other method
• To release the doors at any time, press on the door release button on the wall or on the red button on the magnetic hold.

### Building Code of Australia requirements:

• Fire passageways and doors must have a minimum clearance of 1500mm (1.5meters)
• No equipment can in any way obstruct this space
• All extinguishers and fire hose reels must be kept clear & accessible at all times
• Exits signs must not be covered or obstructed.
As required by the Building Code of Australia the NIDA Building is equipped with smoke detectors. Smoke detectors are designed to provide early warning of a fire. When activated, they begin an alarm & evacuation sequence by activating the Main Fire Panel in the FOH office. Once activated, the Fire Panel communicates internally with the building’s evacuation alarms and externally with the Fire Brigade.

### Smoke Isolation

• In order to use theatrical haze or smoke in any Parade Theatres Venue the detectors in the area must be smoke isolated and all doors to the venue must be closed (any smoke spill will activate other detectors)
• Areas must be isolated before grinding, welding or any operations which create dust.
• The procedure for isolating for any venue is:
• Submit an “Isolation Request”, detailing a schedule of dates and exact times required for smoke sensor isolation of a venue to the Parade Theatres Manager
• At the time of scheduled isolation, contact Reception to confirm that the area has been isolated. Do not proceed with smoke/ haze/ welding etc. without direct confirmation
• Check the Mimic Panel in the venue to confirm the “ISOLATE” status.
• As soon as smoke has cleared and is no longer required, notify Reception in order that detectors can be de-isolated.
Each venue has a Mimic indicator panel showing current isolation status.
• When a venue is smoke isolated, it will light up on the panel as “ISOLATE”
• Please be aware that when a venue is in “ISOLATE” it is no longer connected to the EWIS system
• If the venue is isolated and the “ALARM” light is illuminated this means that one of the smoke detectors in the venue is working correctly and has detected smoke. The building alarm will not activate when this light is illuminated if the venue is isolated. Requests to de-isolate must not be made when in “ALARM” as the evacuation process will commence. Smoke must be cleared and the system showing “ISOLATE” before de-isolating.
• If there is a fire in an isolated venue anyone aware of the fire must use the “Break Glass” alarm to activate the alarm system
The Stage Manager for any production requiring a venue to be ‘isolated’ must prepare a “Management in Use Plan” to submit to the Parade Theatres Manager detailing emergency and evacuation procedures.
