It is important to describe the location or direction of objects, people and movement on stage.
The American/ UK terms ‘Stage Left’ & ‘Stage Right’ are as seen from stage facing out to the auditorium. In Australia, we use the terms Prompt Side and Opposite Prompt Side.
Stage Left = Prompt Side (PS)
Stage Right = Opposite Prompt (OP)
The calling Stage Manager is usually located downstage prompt side, known as Prompt Corner.
Movement from the sides towards centre is referred to as ‘Onstage’. From centre to the sides is ‘Offstage’ Towards the rear of stage is ‘Upstage’. Towards the auditorium is ‘Downstage’
Objects or fly-battens are flown ‘IN’ (Down) or ‘OUT’ (Up)
Numbering or registration on the stage is from stage apron upstage and out from centre. In the Auditorium things are numbered downstage and out from centre.
