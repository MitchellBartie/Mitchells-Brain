### Common Risks:
- Fall from a height
- Injury from objects falling from a height
- Damage to scaffolding from incorrect assembly and use 

### Summary:
- Follow the Safe Work Method
- The Scaffold Tower must only be constructed by those who have been trained in its use.
- Once constructed, the Scaffold Tower must be signed off before use by a qualified Staff Supervisor
- Minimum of 2 people required when the tower is in use (1 person on the ground at all times)
- The Scaffolding Tower platform can hold a MAXIMUM of 2 people
- Kick rails must be in place before the Scaffold Tower is used.
- The platform must only be accessed via the internal ladder (Never climb up the outside)
- Never carry loads up the scaffold tower ladder, use a hauling line
- Secure tools etc to yourself to ensure nothing falls from a height
- The Scaffold Tower should be on a level and secure area, and when in position, the wheels locked
- Closed, flat-soled shoes must be worn

### Important Points to remember are:
• Never carry loads up the Scaffold Tower
• Access the platform via the internal ladder.
• Never move the Scaffold Tower whilst people and/or loads are on the platform, make sure they are warned prior to moving, and the Scaffold Tower is moved at a slow pace. Outriggers (when used) should be raised 10-20mm from the ground before moving and set back to the ground following any move.
• Ensure wheels are locked in place when Scaffold Tower is in position
• Never hang lights over the outside of the Scaffold Tower- only on the inside
