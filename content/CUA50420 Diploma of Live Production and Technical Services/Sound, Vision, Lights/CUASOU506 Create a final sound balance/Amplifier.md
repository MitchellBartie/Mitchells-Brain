An Amplifier boosts the signal level of an output such as a microphone, laptop, or sound console, so it is powerful enough to move the drivers of a speaker. Amplifiers are placed before the speaker in the signal flow. [[Passive Speakers]] require an Amplifier and connect to each other using a cable with a [[Speakon]] connector, while [[Active Speakers]] have inbuilt Amplifiers and connect straight to the sound console using an audio cable with a 3 pin [[XLR]] connector.
