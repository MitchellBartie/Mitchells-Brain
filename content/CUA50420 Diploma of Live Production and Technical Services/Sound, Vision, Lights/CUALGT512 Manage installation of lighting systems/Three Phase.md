Three Phase is a type of [[Electricity]] delivery. Electricity is generated by continuously rotating a magnet that is surrounded by a wire coil. Three separate currents are generated by each revolution of the magnet, and each current is 120Â° out of phase with the other currents. This means that if there is a fault between two of the phases, the potential voltage is doubled. It is recommended to keep a safe working distance between equipment powered by Three Phase because a potential lethal shock of 400 Volts is possible if a fault occurs.
