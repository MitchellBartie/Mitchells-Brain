[[Fixtures]] are hung on [[Bars]] by connecting the yoke to a hanging clamp with a suspension bolt. It is crucial that safety chains are attached to all [[Fixtures]] to prevent them from falling if the clamp or suspension bolt fails.

***Fixture Suspension***

Rigging Checklist:
 . Yoke is vertical
 . Tight hanging clamp
 . The fixture is the correct way up with the power cable at the bottom
 . Safety chain is attached to the anchor point on the fixture, and looped around the bar with enough slack to allow for full rotation of the fixture
 . Ensure the fixture can freely pan and tilt
 . Roughly check the beam of light won't be obstructed by other [[Fixtures]] for its needed purpose
 . Ensure the [[Colour Frame]] and [[Barndoors]] are secured to the fixture so they won't fall out when the fixture is tilted
 . Open [[Barndoors]] and [[Shutters]] 

# De-Rigging 

[[Fixtures]] should be De-Rigged in the following order:
 . Power off the fixture
 . Unplug the power and/or data cables and coil them
 . Close [[Shutters]] or [[Barndoors]] 
 . Rotate fixture to vertical position
 . Remove the safety chain from the bar, and coil it, while still attached to the fixture
 . Loosen hanging clamp wing nut
 . Take the fixture off the bar and place it in its road case or lens down on the floor
 . Remove any accessories such as [[Colour Filters]], [[Gobos]], [[Barndoors]], and place them into storage
 . Coil remaining cables
