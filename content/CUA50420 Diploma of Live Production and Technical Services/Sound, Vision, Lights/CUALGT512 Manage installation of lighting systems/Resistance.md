Resistance is measured in Ohms and can be altered in [[Electricity]] by changing the diameter of the cable used, and the pins on each plug. Resistance occurs as [[Amps]] pass through a conductor causing a reduction in [[Volts]]. This affects the [[Wattage]] that is supplied, and the safe working load. 15 Amp cables with a length of 50m or more have a critical drop in [[Volts]] which reduces it's safe working load. When using power cables of long lengths, it is important to increase the [[Amps]] rating of the cable.
