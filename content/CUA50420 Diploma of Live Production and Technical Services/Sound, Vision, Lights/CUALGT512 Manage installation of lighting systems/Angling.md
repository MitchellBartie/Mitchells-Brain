Angling [[Fixtures]] is needed to ensure the beam of light hits the required spot. [[Fixtures]] are held in a U-shaped bracket that allows them to be panned and tilted. To pan a fixture, it can be rotated by the suspension bolt from the hanging clamp. To tilt a fixture, adjust the wing nuts that tighten the yoke of the fixture.

To save time when adjusting the position of [[Fixtures]], a [[Friction Hanging Bolt Suspension]] assembly should be used.
