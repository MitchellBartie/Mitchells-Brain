If a fixture is not working, the following checklist should be used:
 . Switch off any power running to the fixture
 . Check the [[Circuit Breaker]] on [[Dimmer Units]] or mains power that the fixture is connected to
 . If the [[Circuit Breaker]] is set to the on position, swap the fixture for a known working one to eliminate any wiring issues
 . If the [[Circuit Breaker]] is tripped, or the [[Fuse]] is blown, this means there is an electrical fault somewhere or the [[Lamp]] in the fixture is blown
 . Allow the fixture to cool down
 . Disconnect power and/or data cables
 . Strike the fixture
. Look for visible defects or electrical faults, and if unsure, send it to someone qualified for inspection and [[Test and Tag]] procedures
. Look for visible defects in the [[Lamp]], if the filament is intact then there could be an electrical fault, the fixture should be replaced
. If the filament is damaged, or if the [[Lamp]] has visible defects, follow [[Lamp Replacement]] procedures
. Test the new lamp and fixture with a known working outlet and wiring
. If the fixture still doesn't work, then there is most likely an electrical fault
. If the fixture works, rig it and connect the original wiring, and test again
