Friction Hanging Bolt Suspension saves time when [[Angling]] [[Fixtures]] because it eliminates the need for a spanner every time a fixture is adjusted. The use of flat washers between each moving surface under pressure from a spring washer keeps tension on the fixture, therefore allowing it to be panned or tilted without any additional movement when it is in position.
