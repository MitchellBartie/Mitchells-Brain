Profile spot [[Fixtures]] contain a Plano-Convex lens which has one flat and one curved surface.

***Plano-Convex Lens - GMSL***

They can be focused to produce a hard or soft edged, precise beam of light. These [[Fixtures]] can be shaped and have very little spill light. They are used for projecting light over longer throw distances with a long throw [[Beam Angle]] of 18째 - 34째, and a short throw [[Beam Angle]] of 24째 - 44째. They are generally used for FOH light. These [[Fixtures]] can also be used to project [[Gobos]]. They are generally positioned FOH, onstage overhead, or side stage.

### Optical System

The optical system of Profile [[Fixtures]] have a fixed lamp tray and reflector. The lamp tray has a separate adjustment to produce a [[Flat Beam]] or [[Peak Beam]]. The beam of light can be shaped using different items such as [[Irises]], [[Shutters]], and [[Gobos]] which are placed in the [[Gate]]. Zoom Profile [[Fixtures]] have moveable lenses to focus and adjust the beam size, while [[Fixed Beam]] Profile [[Fixtures]] have interchangeable [[Lens Tubes]] to adjust the beam size. In Zoom Profile [[Fixtures]], the front lens adjusts the beam size, the rear lens adjusts the focus, both lenses move together for a wide beam adjustment, and both lenses move apart for a spot beam adjustment.
