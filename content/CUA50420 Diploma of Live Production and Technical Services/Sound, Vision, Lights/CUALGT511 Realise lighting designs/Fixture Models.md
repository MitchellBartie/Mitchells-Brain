Some manufacturers use the [[Wattage]] and generic name to identify their [[Fixtures]], for example, 650W [[Fresnel]]. Other manufactures link the the name of the model to the [[Wattage]], for example, Acclaim [[Fresnel]] (650W range).
[[Profile]] [[Fixtures]] are usually identified by their beam angle, for example, Acclaim [[Axial]] 18-34. However, some [[Profile]] [[Fixtures]] are also identified by the size of their lens, for example, Alt. 6" [[Profile]].
