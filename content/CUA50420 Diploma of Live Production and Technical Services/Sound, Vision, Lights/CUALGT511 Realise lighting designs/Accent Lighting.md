Accent Lighting can be created using side, down, cross, and [[Back Lighting]]. Accent lighting can provide the dominant source of light using more saturated warm and cool colours to create the mood or atmosphere of a scene. It shows the colour and direction of the artificial or natural light within a scene. For example, [[Side Lighting]] can be used for strong shafts of sunlight coming in through a window, [[Down Lighting]] can be used for an overhead ceiling lamp, and [[Back Lighting]] can be used to imitate moonlight.
