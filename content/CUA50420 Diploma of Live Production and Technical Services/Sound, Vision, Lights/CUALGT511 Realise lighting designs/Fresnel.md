These [[Fixtures]] create a soft edged beam of light that is evenly distributed, with a soft shadow edge, creating spill light. Fresnel [[Fixtures]] can light large areas from a short throw distance and have an adjustable beam angle of 6° - 60°. The soft spill light blends overlapping beams of light together, creating smooth washes. The [[Fixtures]] are used for area, side, and back lighting. They are usually positioned onstage overhead, side stage, or upstage.

### Optical System

The lamp of Fresnel [[Fixtures]] are mounted base down at 90° to the central axis and is parallel to the [[Lens system]]. The lamps filament is positioned at the centre of the radius of the curvature of the spherical reflector. The beam of light is reflected back through the filament and focused along the central axis through the lens. To adjust the beam size, the [[Lamp]] tray can be moved away from the lens to create a spot focus, or towards the lens to produce a flood focus.
