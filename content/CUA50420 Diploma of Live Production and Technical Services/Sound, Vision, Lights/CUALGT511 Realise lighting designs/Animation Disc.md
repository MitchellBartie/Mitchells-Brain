Animation Discs are placed in the [[Colour Frame]] holders of [[Fixtures]]. They create the effect of movement by rotating an etched metal disc with a motor. They are similar to [[Gobos]], and project rotating patterns and images. The electric motor has onboard speed and direction controls that can be powered by an independent power supply, or the motor can be connected to a dimmer circuit for remote control from a [[Lighting Console]]. 
Animation Discs create the best effect when they are used in combination with [[Gobos]]. They can turn a static gobo into a flame, water, or moving cloud effect for example. The addition of split colours either in the fixture's [[Colour Frame]] or on the Animation Disc can also enhance the effect. 
To produce a side to side motion, mount the motor on the top of the [[Lens Tubes]], and to create an up or down motion, mount the motor on the side of the [[Lens Tubes]]. 
When [[Focusing]] the light, it is best to focus it in between a hard and soft focus. When the gobo has a hard focus, there will be minimal animation movement, however while there will be maximum movement with a soft focus, the gobo pattern will be lost.
