Axial Ellipsoidal Profile [[Fixtures]] have a compact filament lamp which is mounted axially along the central axis of the fixture. The filament of the lamp is positioned at the focal point of a half elliptical [[Reflector]]. The beam of light is reflected back along the central axis of the fixture through a [[Hot Mirror]] and the [[Gate]] to a second focal point. The [[Flat Beam]] and [[Peak Beam]] adjustment for Axial Ellipsoidal [[Profile]] [[Fixtures]] can be found on the back of the fixture in the form of two wheels or knobs. When the wheel is turned clockwise, the filament will move in creating a [[Flat Beam]], and when the wheel is turned anti clockwise, the filament will move out producing a [[Peak Beam]].
