Focusing [[Fixtures]] means to set the size and focus of the light beam. This can only be done with [[Adjustable Beam Fixtures]]. 

Different [[Fixtures]] have different focus options:
 . [[Fresnel]] and [[PC]] [[Fixtures]]: The beam can be adjusted from a small (spot) to a large (flood) spread
 . [[Profile]] [[Fixtures]]: The beam can be adjusted from soft to hard edged, and from a small spot to a large spot

[[Fixed Beam]] [[Fixtures]] cannot be focussed. These include:
 . [[Parcan]] [[Fixtures]]
 . [[Flood]] [[Fixtures]]
