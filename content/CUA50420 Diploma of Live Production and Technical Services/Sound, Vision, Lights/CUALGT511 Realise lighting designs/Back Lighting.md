Back Lighting is used to create a halo effect by creating strong highlights on the shoulders and back of an actor's head. The entire stage or acting areas use steeply angled [[Fixtures]] to create Back Lighting. 
Direct Back Lighting utilises [[Fixtures]] that are mounted directly behind an acting area or upstage. 
Quarter Back Lighting uses [[Fixtures]] that are mounted at 45° angles behind the acting area or upstage.
[[Fresnel]] [[Fixtures]] are a good option for Back Lighting when used with [[Barndoors]] because they produce a wide beam with a soft focus. [[Profile]] [[Fixtures]] can also be used for Back Lighting when they have a 90° [[Beam Angle]], and they add the option for the use of [[Gobos]] which can break up the beam and highlight the effect.
