Colour Frames are used to hold [[Colour Filters]] in [[Fixtures]]. They are inserted into the front set of colour runners to allow for ventilation, however when [[Barndoors]] are used, the colour frames can be inserted into the second set of colour runners. It is important to use a colour frame because over time [[Conventional Fixtures]] produce a lot of heat, which causes plasticity in the [[Colour Filters]], so the use of a colour frame keeps the filter straight, and stops it from buckling.
