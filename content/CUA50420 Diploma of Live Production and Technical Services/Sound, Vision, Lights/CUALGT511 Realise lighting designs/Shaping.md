The beam of light produced by [[Profile]] [[Fixtures]] can be shaped using the [[Shutters]]. This produces angular, rectangular, or diamond shaped beams of light. This is useful to get unwanted light off objects such as the [[Proscenium Arch]], [[Masking]], or [[Set Pieces]]. 

[[Gobos]] can also be used to shape the beam of light by projecting patterns, images, or [[Focusing]] the beam of light to make it smaller.

[[Irises]] can be placed in the [[Gate]] of fixed lens [[Profile]] [[Fixtures]] to change the size of the light beam, and they are also used in followspots.

The beam of light can also be shaped using the [[Peak Beam]] and [[Flat Beam]] adjustments. This makes a hotspot more or less prominent.

[[Donuts]] can be used to increase the clarity of projected light from [[Gobos]] by reducing halation and sharpening the light. They are also inserted into the [[Gate]] of [[Ellipsoidal]] [[Profile]] [[Fixtures]].

To reduce the glare and reflection created from [[Fixtures]], a [[Top hat]] can be inserted into the [[Colour Frame]] of [[Profile]], [[Axial]], and [[Parcan]] [[Fixtures]].

For [[Fixed Beam]] [[Fixtures]] such as [[PC]] and [[Fresnel]] units, the beam can be shaped using [[Barndoors]]. They are used to reduce spill light, and to mask unwanted light on things such as the [[Proscenium Arch]], [[Set Pieces]], and overshooting into the audience.
