Dimmer Packs generally contain six dimmer units in one portable pack that have a single or pair of sockets on the front or rear of the pack that allow for fixtures to be [[Hard Patched]] to any dimmer. Dimmer Packs are usually used for smaller productions, in smaller venues, or for temporary installations. 

[[Patch Panels]] are usually located under or next to the Dimmer Packs which have numbered sockets terminated to plugs which allows for any [[Fixtures]] to be [[Hard Patched]] to any dimmer. With Dimmer Packs, multiple fixtures can be [[Hard Patched]] to a single dimmer. For example, [[Fixtures]] 1 and 2 can be plugged into socket 5, which terminates at the [[Patch Panels]] into a plug numbered 5, which is then [[Hard Patched]] into dimmer 10. This means that [[Fixtures]] 1 and 2 are controlled by dimmer 10, or [[Control Channel]] 10 on a [[Lighting Console]] with a 1:1 [[Soft Patch]].
