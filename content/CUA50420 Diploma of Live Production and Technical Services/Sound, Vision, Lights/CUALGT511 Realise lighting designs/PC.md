PC is an abbreviation for either Prism/Pebble-Convex, or Plano-Convex. 
# Prism/Pebble-Convex 
Prism/Pebble-Convex [[Fixtures]] use a Plano-Convex lens that is cast with prisms or is stippled. This creates bumps on the lens that soften the edge of the light beam.

***Prism-Convex Lens - GMSL*** 

Prism/Pebble-Convex [[Fixtures]] produce a crisp semi-soft edge beam of light that has less spill light than a [[Fresnel]], however can still be used to blend overlapping beams of light. They are used to create large or small areas of light from large or small throw distances with a beam angle of 4° - 64°. They can be used for [[Special Effects]], washes, and side lighting. They are generally found onstage overhead, or side stage.

# Plano-Convex
Plano-Convex [[Fixtures]] contain a lens with a highly polished flat surface. They are available in 1k, 2K, and 2.5K variants.

***Plano-Convex Lens - GMSL***

They produce a sharp, zoomed beam of light that does not create any spill light with a beam angle of 4° - 64°. To shape the beam, [[Barndoors]] are required. These [[Fixtures]] are used to project a controlled beam of light over longer throws, and are a quicker alternative to focus than [[Profile]] [[Fixtures]]. The general use is for FOH lighting, and they can be positioned overhead onstage or side stage.

### Optical System

The lamp of PC [[Fixtures]] are mounted base down at 90° to the central axis and is parallel to the [[Lens system]]. The lamps filament is positioned at the centre of the radius of the curvature of the spherical reflector. The beam of light is reflected back through the filament and focused along the central axis through the lens. To adjust the beam size, the [[Lamp]] tray can be moved away from the lens to create a spot focus, or towards the lens to produce a flood focus.
