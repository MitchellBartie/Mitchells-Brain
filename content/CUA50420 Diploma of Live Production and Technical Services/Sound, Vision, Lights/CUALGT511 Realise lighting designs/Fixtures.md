Lanterns, Luminaires, Spotlights, Fixtures, Instruments, and Units are the names given to the housing that contains the [[Lamp]], [[Reflector]], and [[Lens system]].

Fixtures use these elements to produce light. They can be hung from [[Bars]], [[Booms]], or attached to [[Stands]]. After they are hung, the next step is [[Adjusting Fixtures]].

Fixtures can be powered by flexible cables or hardwired to [[Patch Panels]]. [[Conventional Fixtures]] are then connected to [[Dimmer Units]] and [[LED]] or [[DMX]] controlled fixtures are connected to independent switch circuits.

***Lanterns, Dimmers, and Control: Understanding the Lighting System***

The main identifying factors of a fixture are the housing, [[Lens system]], [[Reflector]], and the quality of the light beam produced.
The five types of [[Generic]] [[Tungsten-Halogen]] fixtures are:
 . [[Profile]]
 . [[Fresnel]]
 . [[Flood]]
 . [[PC]]
 . [[Parcan]]
These fixtures can be placed into two main categories:
 . [[Fixed Beam]]
 . [[Adjustable Beam Fixtures]]

The [[Fixture Models]] can be grouped together by their [[Wattage]].

[[Conventional Fixtures]] cannot change the colour of the lamp they use, so to add colour to these fixtures, [[Colour Filters]] need to be inserted into the [[Colour Frame]].
