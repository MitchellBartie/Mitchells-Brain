A Hot Mirror is a component in the heat management system of [[Profile]] [[Fixtures]] that diverts infrared rays. It is located in the end of fixtures. The device reduces the heat in the light beam which therefore increases the life of [[Colour Filters]] and [[Gobos]]. The Hot Mirror also produces a whiter light because it acts as a selective filter that manages the colour balance.
