The Parcan has a sealed beam PAR lamp. This means that the [[Fixtures]] have a lamp in front of a Parabolic Aluminised Reflector, and a lens in a sealed unit. The Parcan produces an intense, near parallel, oval beam of light that can be rotated. They were originally designed for pop concerts as they produce a wide or narrow beam of light that is good for saturated colours, and can be used for overhead, back, and side lighting. They are generally found overhead upstage, side stage, on the floor, and for special effects.

Parcans are [[Fixed Beam]] [[Fixtures]] which means the beam size cannot be adjusted. The beam size is determined by the lamp that is fitted in the fixture. There are three main types of lamps that can be used:

 . Clear PAR lamp: This lamp is clear with a flat surface. It is 9° x 12° which produces a very narrow spot. There is also a frosted lamp which is 10° x 14° and produces a narrow spot.

 . Criss-Cross Pattern Lens: This lamp has a criss-cross pattern stippled on the surface and is 11° x 24° which produces a medium flood.

To position the oval beam shape, rotate the lamp housing with the adjustment knob at the rear of the fixture.
