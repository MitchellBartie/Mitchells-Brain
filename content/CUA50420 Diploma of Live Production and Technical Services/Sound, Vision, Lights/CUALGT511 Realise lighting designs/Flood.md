The two types of Flood [[Fixtures]] are the 90 Degree Flood - Symmetric, and the [[Cyc]] Flood - Asymmetric. 

# 90 Degree Flood
The 90 Degree Flood has a [[Fixed Beam]] with a symmetrical [[Reflector]] and produces a soft, intense, even wash of light with minimal spill. Traditionally, these [[Fixtures]] are used as overhead washes for door and window backings. They are usually found overhead onstage, or on Lighting [[Stands]].

# Cyc Flood
The [[Cyc]] Flood has a [[Fixed Beam]] with an asymmetrical [[Reflector]] and produces a soft, intense, even wash of light with minimal spill on vertical surfaces. The main use for these [[Fixtures]] are [[Cyc]] lighting, and [[Skycloth]] lighting. They can also be used to light backdrops, curtains, and scenery. They can be used as single fixtures, or joined together in banks of three or four to create colour mixing possibilities. These [[Fixtures]] are usually found upstage as overhead or floor [[Cyc]] lights, or downstage as [[Foot Lights]].
