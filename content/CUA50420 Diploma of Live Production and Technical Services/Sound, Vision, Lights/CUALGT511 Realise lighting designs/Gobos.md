Gobos are stainless steel or glass discs that are inserted into a [[Gobo Holder]]. The [[Gobo Holder]] is then inserted into the [[Gate]] of [[Profile]] [[Fixtures]]. The disc has patterns, or images etched into them that allows the wanted light to pass through, while blocking the unwanted light. This allows the patterns or images to be projected onto surfaces, and to be used for aerial effects when combined with [[Haze]]. Gobos have to be inserted upside down because the [[Lens system]] inverts the projected image.
