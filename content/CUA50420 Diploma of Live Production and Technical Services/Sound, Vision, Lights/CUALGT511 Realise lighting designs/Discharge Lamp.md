The Discharge [[Lamp]] is a Metal-Halide Lamp. They have two metals rods with a small gap and are enclosed in a gas-filled glass envelope. When high voltage electricity is passed between electrodes, the gas becomes conductive and emits light. Discharge lamps have a brighter intensity and longer life than an [[Incandescent Lamp]], however, they cannot be dimmed, therefore, [[Fixtures]] that use Discharge lamps use [[Shutters]] to block out the light, producing a dimming effect. When some Discharge lamps are turned off, they cannot be restruck while hot, and may take 15-20 minutes to cool down before they can be restruck. Discharge lamps have a significantly higher [[Colour Temperature]] than an [[Incandescent Lamp]], therefore creating some issues when blending generic [[Fixtures]] with [[Moving Lights]]. These lamps are generally found in [[Moving Lights]], [[Follow Spots]], Effect Projectors, and some film and television [[Fixtures]]. 

There are four types of Discharge Lamps. These are:
 . [[CSI]]
 . [[CDM]]
 . [[HMI]]
 . [[MSR]]
