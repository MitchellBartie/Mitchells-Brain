[[Profile]] [[Fixtures]] contain four rotating shutters that make cuts into the beam of light when they are slid in, producing an angular, rectangular, and diamond shaped beam of light. They are found in the [[Gate]] of [[Profile]] [[Fixtures]]. When the shutters are slid in, they affect the opposite side of the beam. Shutters can be used to remove unwanted light, for example, light that overshoots the stage, hits the [[Proscenium Arch]], [[Set Pieces]], or [[Masking]].
